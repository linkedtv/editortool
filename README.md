LinkedTV Editor Tool
==========

In the LinkedTV project, the Editor Tool (ET) enables moderation of (named) entities and hyperlinks, which are automatically extracted from 
audiovisual content with the purpose of creating useful metadata for editorial teams that are responsible for e.g. 
publishing interactive television programmes.

Documentation will follow while working towards the next release in September of this year (2014)
