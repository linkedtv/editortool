LinkedTV Editor Tool
==========

In the LinkedTV project (http://linkedtv.eu), the Editor Tool (ET) enables moderating (named) entities and hyperlinks, which are
automatically extracted from audiovisual content. This data is created to provide a useful starting point for editorial teams
that are responsible for publishing interactive television programmes, which aim to offer contextual information to viewers.

(More) documentation will follow while working towards the next release in September of this year (2014)
